## Description

[Click here to view project on Github Pages](https://oskarradon.github.io/vacation-quiz/)

 Create a webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery) where a user can go to answer a few questions about themselves and the site will return a vacation destination to them based on their answers. You should have at least 5 questions for your user and you should have at least 3 destinations that could be suggested.
 - All previous standards (last review's objectives) are in place
 - Site uses branching and looping to return destination
 - jQuery is used to show and hide destination after questions are answered and submitted.
 - Form gathers input from the user
 - Variable names are descriptive of what they represent
 - Web page is styled using Bootstrap and CSS

## Technologies Used

## Known Bugs
